# Arduino Computer
A project I started a long time ago with the goal of running code off of an SD card and being able to program on the finished device. 

Physical hardware includes:
 - 4D systems' 43-PT (touch screen)
 - SD card reader
 - PS/2 Keyboard
 - Custom built SRAM module ( https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/IanCharrettDykes/SRAM )
 - An Arduino Mega 2560 (as CPU / BIOS )
